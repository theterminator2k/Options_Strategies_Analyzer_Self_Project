# Options_Strategies_Analyzer_Self_Project

Out of an interest in Derivatives and a desire to learn more about them, I had completed the course Derivatives - Options & Futures" from
Interactive Brokers on Coursera. After completion, I felt it would be an interesting exercise to visualize the strategies I'd learnt based on Black Scholes calculated option prices and the option Greeks. Strike price can be changed as one chooses and the excel file will generate the Black Scholes price along with the Greeks and graph the returns over different stock prices at time of expiry for various options strategies.
